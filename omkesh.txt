Now let me provide you with the complete step-by-step instructions to upload your project to GitHub:

🚀 Complete GitHub Upload Guide
Step 1: Install Git (if not already installed)
Download Git for Windows:
Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
Download and install with default settings
Restart your command prompt after installation
Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.com and sign in (or create account)
Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
Repository settings:
Name: portfolio-website (or your preferred name)
Description: Modern responsive portfolio website with contact form and dark/light theme
Public repository (recommended for portfolio)
Don't check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
Click "Create repository"
Step 3: Upload Your Project
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Here's what you need to do:

Command
pwd
PS C:\Users\omkesh360\Downloads\portfolio2> pwd

Path
----
C:\Users\omkesh360\Downloads\portfolio2


Perfect! You're in the right directory. Now, once you have Git installed, run these commands in PowerShell:

Step 4: Git Commands to Upload
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Modern portfolio website with contact form"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
To make your website live:

Go to your repository on GitHub
Click "Settings" tab
Scroll to "Pages" section
Source: Select "Deploy from a branch"
Branch: Select "main" and "/ (root)"
Click "Save"
Your website will be live at: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio-website
